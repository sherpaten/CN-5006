In this week I write an programmed using react and React API. In this I used useffect, usestate, clickhandel etc. I did two type of programming One is counter and second is emojee counter.
In counter.js I import react to start with. Then I called two different function one is Hook_ControlledButtonState
and second is ClickHandle function. After completing this I import counter.js folder in my index folder.
Second Programme was about EmojeeCounter.js. In this I call a different function from the previous one which is EmojeeCounter(Prop) 
and use UsedEffect too. Rest of the process is similar
I have also added some of the pic and js file in my comming folder.
